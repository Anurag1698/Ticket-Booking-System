# Ticket Booking System

## Overview
The Ticket Booking System is a web-based application designed to manage seat reservations in a theater-like environment. Users can view available seats, book tickets, cancel reservations, and search for customers. Additional features include displaying all customers with sorting options and viewing canceled tickets.

## Features
### Seat Management
- Display Seats: View a grid of seats, with booked seats marked in green and available seats in aqua. Clicking on an available seat allows selection for booking.
- Book Tickets: Book a seat by entering customer details (name and age). Ensures no duplicate bookings.
- Cancel Tickets: Cancel a booked seat, and its details are added to a queue of canceled tickets.
### Customer Management
- Search by Name: Search for a customer by name, with optional filtering by age if multiple matches are found.
- Display All Customers: View details of all booked customers sorted by:
    - Booking order
    - Alphabetical order of names
    - Age order
### Canceled Tickets
- Show Canceled Tickets: View details of all canceled tickets stored in a queue, including seat number, customer name, and age.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
